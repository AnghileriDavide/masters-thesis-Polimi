In this thesis we present two approaches to improve automatic playtesting using player modeling. By modeling various cohorts of players we are able to train Convolutional Neural Network based agents that simulate human gameplay using different strategies directly learnt from real player data. The goal is to use the developed agents to predict useful metrics of newly created game content. 

We validated our approaches using the game \textit{Candy Crush Saga}, a non-deterministic match-3 puzzle game with a huge search space and more than three thousand levels available. Nevertheless, the presented approaches are general and can be extended to other games as well. The proposed approaches are compared to a baseline approach that simulate gameplay using a single strategy learnt from random gameplay data. Results show that by simulating different strategies, our approaches can more accurately predict the player difficulty, measured as the player success rate, on new levels. Furthermore, the proposed approaches can provide useful insight to better understand the players and the game.
